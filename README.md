# DL-Breast-Cancer-Classification

## Overview

This project implements a Deep Learning approach for classifying breast cancer using histopathological images. The goal is to automatically distinguish between benign and malignant tissues using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MassimilianoVisintainer/DL-Breast-Cancer-Classification.git
    cd DL-Breast-Cancer-Classification
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of histopathological images. These images are classified into benign and malignant categories. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images).

- **Directory structure:**
    ```
    dataset/
    ├── benign/
    └── malignant/
    ```

- Place the images in the respective folders before running the training script.

## Model Architecture

The classification model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.

- **Main features:**
  - Pre-trained networks (such as ResNet or VGG) can be fine-tuned for this task.
  - Data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting.
  - Model uses categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the dataset is organized as described in the "Dataset" section.
2. Modify any hyperparameters or paths in the configuration file or main script if needed.
3. Run the classification script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

## Training

To train the model on your dataset:

1. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
    ```

Training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can be configured in the `train.py` file or passed as command-line arguments.

## Evaluation

Once training is completed, the model can be evaluated on a test set:

```bash
python evaluate.py --test_path /path/to/test/dataset
```

## Results

The model performance is evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also generated to provide insight into the classification results.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
